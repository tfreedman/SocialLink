# SocialLink

SocialLink is a custom social networking client - it presents everything grouped by person in chronological order, regardless of the underlying account or service used to initially post. Rather than following John Smith on a bunch of individual platforms, you can simply follow John Smith and see everything they post, with no algorithmic filtering.
